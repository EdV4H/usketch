Fix severe FPS drop while dragging shapes when `debug-hud` is enabled.

- `@edv4h/usketch-plugin-debug-hud` now coalesces event-log notifications via `requestAnimationFrame`, so a burst of `shape:updated` events during a drag triggers at most one HUD re-render per frame. The capture path is also gated on HUD visibility: while the HUD is hidden, the monkey-patched `emit` short-circuits to a single boolean read and pushes nothing into the logger.
- `@edv4h/usketch-core` / `@edv4h/usketch-shared`: `EventBus` gains `pause()`, `resume()`, and `isPaused()`. `emit()` becomes a no-op while paused; `on()`/`off()` keep working so subscribers registered during a paused window receive events after resume. Provided as a general-purpose hook for callers that need to suspend delivery during hot paths.
